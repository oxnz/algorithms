# Heap Sort

##Background: Binary Trees

* Has a root at the topmost level
* Each node has zero, one or two children
* A node that has no child is called a leaf
* For a node x, we denote the left child, right child and the parent
of x as left(x), right(x) and parent(x), respectively

##Height (Depth) of a Binary Tree

The number of edges on the longest path from the root to a leaf.

##Background: Complete Binary Trees

* A complete binary tree is the tree
  * WHere a node can have 0(for the leaves) or 2 children and
  * All leaves are at the same depth
* No. of nodes and height
  * A complete binary tree with N nodes has height O(logN)
  * A complete binary tree with height d has, in total, 2d+1-1 nodes
